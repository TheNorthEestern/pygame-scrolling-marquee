# Image Marquee Using Pygame

This is a very simple demonstration of resource loading and basic I/O
using pygame

To install:
  - sudo easy_install pip (_If you don't already have pip installed_)
  - sudo pip install -r requirements.txt (_This part of the process is
    very finicky, please let me know if it doesn't work_)
  - python marquee.py
