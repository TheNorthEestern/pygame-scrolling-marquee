# Image Marquee Using Pygame

This is a very simple demonstration of resource loading and basic I/O
using pygame

To install:
  - sudo easy__install pip (__If you don't already have pip installed__)
  - sudo pip install virtualenv (__If you don't already have virtualenv
    installed__)
  - virtualenv venv/ --distribute
  - source venv/bin/activate (activate your environment)
  - sudo pip install -r requirements.txt (__This part of the process is
    very finicky, please let me know if it doesn't work__)
  - python marquee.py

If all goes well, use the arrow keys to control the marquee image!
